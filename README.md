🔍 Currently hunting:

Domains without their name in the bucket.

Endpoints that trust too much.

Parameters that echo back a whisper ("FUZZ").

Misconfigs hiding behind 403s.


🚀 Building:

ReconX: A subdomain-to-pwn pipeline.

S3-Hound: Smarter & faster S3 bucket hunter with mirror logic and retries.

Nuclei-Automator: Context-aware nuclei orchestration.


🧠 Mindset:

> I don’t chase CVEs.
I chase logic, loose doors, and forgotten assets.



🪓 Tools I ♥️: nuclei, ffuf, gf, dalfox, openredirex, getJS, subzy, katana, burp, rengine (modded 🛠️)

🎯 Motto:

cat all.txt | grep -i overlooked | grep -i unprotected | xargs exploit

📡 Ping me if:

You have a dead asset to revive.

You believe SSRF is the new RCE.

You think 404 sometimes hides 200 OK.
